# sp3d5s_star

An c++ software package aimed at quantum mechanics based atomistic simulation of semiconductor nanostructures using empiracal tight binding model. 

## Main features of NanoTB are: 

Slater-Koster type sp3d5s* atomic basis semi-empirical parameters for main semiconductor materials; 

1D, 2D and 3D periodic structures of nanostructures up to millions of atoms; 

Electronic band structures, density of states projected to local atom orbitals.
